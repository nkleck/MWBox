This installation of vagrantbox should be useful for malware analysis. Everything in here was made from free software. Do with it what you will, make it better.

[NOTES]----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following programs were installed during the setup, hence the long installation.
- Python and some of its devâ€™s
- Tor
- Proxychains
- Yara
- ssdeep
- clamav

Scripts added (script folder) for analysis
- avsubmit.py
- av_multiscan.py
- pescanner.py
- clam_to_yara.py
- pied_to_yara.py
- dbmgr.py




Things being needed done:
- add a malware sandbox
- build in error handling, output to log file
	- tor installation needs a if then statement since there are different
		ways to install the keys from the keyserver
- build in error handling for some scripts, output to a log file
- install WINE?
- create a cleanup scrip that is last ran in bootstrap
	- cleans up file locations
	- moves setup scripts to config folder, hides config folder
