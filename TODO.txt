TO DO

- Need to figure out a way to make it only run updates and upgrade after the first install
	- when you reboot the box, it does not run the script again, need to execute
		$ vagrant provisioning IOT run script again, maybe add that to the Vagrantfile?
		- the script checks for updates and upgrades for some programs. 
		- ALSO, if this is the case, it wont run the other install scripts either
			- which may be needed to install programs
			- OR JUST PUT IN THE README HOW TO RUN THE UPDATE
				$ vagrant provision




- then start working on scripts. 
  - so a bunch of github repo's, not tying them to this repo, but will dl then upon install
    - this means modifying the script with PATH so they dl and install the ones that need setup
    



- then clean up script. hide files, and upload to github
